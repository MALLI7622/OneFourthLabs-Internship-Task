# OneFourthLabs-Internship-Task
One Fourth Labs Internship Interview Round 1 -- Programming Assessment

For solving this problem, I had used [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) A Machine Learning Library.

I had attached my step-by-step jupyter notebook solution for this problem [here](https://github.com/MALLI7622/OneFourthLabs-Internship-Task/blob/master/oflinterntask.ipynb). 

Below is the Deep Learning Model, I created for solving this problem

After applying different batch sizes, neural networks, and epochs. I had got the following results in trainig

##### Training Accuracy

Training Accuracy at last epoch is:


Epoch 10/10
112800/112800 [==============================] - 34s 302us/sample - loss: 0.2811 - accuracy: 0.8922

##### Testing Accuracy

18800/1 - 3s - loss: 122.0796 - accuracy: 0.8414

Test accuracy: 0.841383

I had explained my solution to the problem step-by-step in the [oflinterntask.ipynb](https://github.com/MALLI7622/OneFourthLabs-Internship-Task/blob/master/oflinterntask.ipynb). I had uploaded it to the GitHub repository

##### Instructions to run the code

I had also uploaded [oflinterntask.py](https://github.com/MALLI7622/OneFourthLabs-Internship-Task/blob/master/oflinterntask.py) file. You can download it and run it in your own system.

If you have tensorflow environment in your system. You can activate by the following command
$ conda activate tensorflow

Go to the Directory where your file was located 
$ cd [Directory name]

Now run the file

$ python oflinterntask.py

###### or 
You can download [oflinterntask.ipynb](https://github.com/MALLI7622/OneFourthLabs-Internship-Task/blob/master/oflinterntask.ipynb) file run each cell in your jupyter notebook for better understanding.
